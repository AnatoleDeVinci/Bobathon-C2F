"""Package root for the Parkinson's UPDRS regression workspace.

Exposes ``PROJECT_ROOT``: the absolute path to the project root,
derived from this file's location. Any module that needs to resolve
a project-relative path (data files, fixtures, configs) imports this
constant instead of hard-coding a CWD-relative string.

This works because the package is installed in editable mode, so
``__file__`` points back into the source tree at
``<root>/src/parkinson/__init__.py`` and ``parents[2]`` is the
project root.
